# ukriversguidebook.co.uk.core

The UK Rivers Guidebook site development repository (Joomla Component and Plugins).

The source found here is not usable on its own, you would need to configure a LAMP stack and then install Joomla, phpBB and bridge them with the JFusion (Joomla extension). This setup is not a trivial piece of configuration.
